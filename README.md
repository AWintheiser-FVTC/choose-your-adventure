# ✨ A Markdown-Based Adventure Framework

Welcome! This repo hosts interactive, emoji-powered **"choose your own adventure"** stories written entirely in Markdown. Each story is structured with branching scenes, embedded choices, and a clear path system — designed for maximum flexibility and fun.

If you'd like to create your own interactive story using this format, read on!

This framework allows you to create interactive adventures using Markdown files. Each scene is a separate Markdown file, and you can link them together to create a branching narrative.

## 🌟 Example Story

[Space Battles](https://github.com/fvtc/choose-your-adventure/blob/master/space-battles/_start-here.md) — A Star Wars-inspired branching adventure.]

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each story should live in its own folder.

Each scene is a Markdown file. You can name the files whatever you like, but they should follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `scene1.md`, `scene2.md`, etc.). However, the first scene should always be named `_start-here.md` to indicate the starting point of the adventure. The underscore prefix helps to keep it at the top of the folder listing.

For an example, the folder structure for a story might look like this:

```
space-battles/
├── _start-here.md
├── scene1.md
├── scene2.md
├── scene3.md
├── scene4.md
├── scene5.md
├── scene6A.md
├── scene6B.md
├── scene6C.md
├── scene7A.md
├── scene7B.md
├── scene8A.md
├── scene9A.md
├── scene10A.md
├── scene10B.md
```

## 📖 Writing Scenes

Each scene is a Markdown file that contains the text of the scene, along with choices that link to other scenes. Here’s a basic structure for a scene:

```markdown
# Scene Title

A short paragraph or two describing the scene. This is where you set the stage for the choices that follow.

> Optional: Include a blockquote for a character's dialogue or internal thoughts.

Then present the choices using bullet points. Each choice should link to another scene file:

- 🛸 [Go to the spaceport](../story-name/scene2A.md)
- 🤖 [Talk to the droid](../story-name/scene2B.md)
- 🚀 [Board the starship](../story-name/scene2C.md)
```

✅ Use emoji to add tone and make choices visually distinct.

✅ Keep scene names short and match the filenames (scene1.md, scene2A.md, etc.).

✅ Use relative links (../story-name/scene2A.md, not absolute URLs).


## 🪐 Design Tips

- Keep choices to 2–3 per scene to avoid overwhelming readers.

- Looping and dead ends are welcome — failure is part of the fun!

- Feel free to mimic familiar storylines or create something totally new.

- Keep your tone consistent (humorous, serious, classic sci-fi, etc.).
