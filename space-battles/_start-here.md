EPISODE IV
A NEW SPARK

It is a time of rebellion. Scattered freedom fighters wage a desperate war against a tyrannical Galactic Dominion that rules the stars with an iron grip.

In a daring strike, the rebels have acquired secret plans to the Dominion’s ultimate weapon — a moon-sized battle station with the power to destroy entire planets.

Pursued by Dominion warships, a lone diplomatic cruiser races home, carrying hope for the galaxy… and destiny for a farm boy on a forgotten desert world.
