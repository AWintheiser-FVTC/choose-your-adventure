# SCENE 3B: Riding the Roller-Coaster 

You decide to take the Roller-Coaster. 

"This ain't so bad.", you think as you go over twists, turns and drops. However, your fun isn't to last as you hear a sound behind you. You look behind...

... only to see giant snake like creature with a ghastly human head chasing you!

You then notice two things. 
1: There are two diverging paths in front of you, one leading into a lit tunnel, the other into a dark one. 
2: You have a switch in front of you that can control where you go. 

So where will you go?
