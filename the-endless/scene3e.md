# SCENE 3E: Exploring the Hotel 

You go down Hallway 2. There's nothing partically special about this hotel compared to others you've been to. But its the sense of eeriness and loneliness about it all that's starting to get to you.

Or maybe not entirely lonely.

"Hello.", a voice calls out.

You turn around.

"Please don't be frightened. I'm a friend I promise. I haven't seen someone for so long."
