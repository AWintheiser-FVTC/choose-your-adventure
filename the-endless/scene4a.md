# SCENE 4A: Go See Who/What It is.

You go to the noise… only to find a monster waiting for you. Luckily, you notice it before it can grab you, and you hightail it out of there. You manage to evade the monster,  but you can tell its not too far behind.
Just then, a rope drops from above you and a voice calls out. 

“This way, my friend! Hurry! There isn’t much time!”

It sounds like another human! Or could it be a trick?
What now?
