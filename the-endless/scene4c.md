# SCENE 4C: You're New Friend

You've found a new friend. He's about the same age as you. Its awesome to see someone, a person just like you. 

The two of you grow close over time. 

"You know we might not be able to get out of here. But at least we have each other.", he says to you.

However, sadly, that's not to last forever.
