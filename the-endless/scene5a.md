# SCENE 5A: Climb the Rope

You take your chances and climb the rope. You look to see who you’re mysterious savior is.

“Hello, my young friend! I am Richard Banner. But, please, just call me Rick. Welcome to the Endless.”, says the old man.

He explains that he has been here for years. He has met others, but they have all fallen victim to the monsters. Rick says you’re not obligated to stay, but he can and will help if you agree.

Do you agree? 

What now?
