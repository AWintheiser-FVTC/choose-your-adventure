# SCENE 6A: Agree to Rickâ€™s Mentorship 

You agree to Rickâ€™s help. He teaches you about various monsters of the Endless and ways to avoid them/escape from them. He teaches you where and when to find food, and proper places for shelter/hiding. 
One day, a friend of Rickâ€™s finds the two of you. They reveal that they found a source control of sorts that if destroyed could potentially stop the monsters for good. They have a plan and have made a map. You think it would be wiser to use the map to try and find an exit, but Rick and his friend are urging to destroy the monsters as payback. 

What should you do?
