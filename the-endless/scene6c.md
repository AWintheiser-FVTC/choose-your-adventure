# SCENE 6C: Saving Your Friend

It takes you long and hard to find your friend, but eventually you do.

"You shouldn't have come. They'll eat you too!", your friend says.

"What are friends for?", you reply sarcastically.

As you two are escaping, the monster returns. You two have to run again. But this time, you're the one that's more exhausted while you're friend is trying to be careful with his asthma.

It won't last forever though.

What happens next?
