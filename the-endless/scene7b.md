# SCENE 7B: Try A Different Path

You decide to copy down the map and take off on your own. While you hate to leave Rick, you believe this is your last chance. So you go off to find multiple potential exit points...

...only to run into monsters everytime. 

You run and run and run. Monsters are on you're tail.

"What were you thinking?!", you say to yourself as you keep running. 

What now?
