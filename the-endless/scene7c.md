# SCENE 7C: Your Friend's Sacrifice 

"Looks like this is it buddy. Sorry you had to come all this way. Stay safe and god be with you!", your friend says.

Before you can object you're thrown forward as the monster grabs your friend. You're friend gives you one final compassionate look, before the monster carries him off, never to be seen again.

You're utterly devestated and depressed following this. You're only companion in this hellscape is now gone and you're all alone... 

That is until you run into another human named Rick Banner and his friend. They explain who they are and what they are planning. 

A mission to a control center that if destroyed could lead to the end of the monsters. Intent on revenge, you go with them.
