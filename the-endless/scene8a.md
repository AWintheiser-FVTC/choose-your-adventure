# SCENE 8A: You Reach the Control Center

You reach the control center, you try to destroy it, but suddenly, the control center… glitches? Its not real! Its a trap! You go to run but both you and Rick notice Rick’s friend isn’t coming. 
“Buddy, what are you doing?! They could be close we have to get out of here!”, Rick pleads.
But he doesn’t come.
